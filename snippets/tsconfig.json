  // These are the settings TypeScript uses to compile TypeScript code to JavaScript:
  "compilerOptions": {
    // The JSX factory is React (rather than any other library)
    "jsx": "react-jsx",

    // We consider 'null' and 'undefined' to not be assignable to other types
    // Without this one, this would be fine: 'let name: string = undefined;'
    // Weird, right? You should basically always want this setting ;)
