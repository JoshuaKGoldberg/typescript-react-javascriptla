    // * "dom" says we're in a browser so things like HTML elements exist
    // * "esnext" says we can use all the latest fancy JavaScript features âœ¨
    "lib": ["dom", "esnext"],

    // Note that this file doesn't enable stricter checks such as noImplicitAny or strictNullChecks.
    // They're very useful but create-react-app uses this file to figure out compilation settings.
    // We don't want to block rendering the page on forgetting to fix a type declaration.
    // Instead, 'npm compile:strict' uses --strict, which enables those checks.

    // ...the rest of these you can read about online if you really want ðŸ˜‰
